<h1>Project Management</h1>
<p>We:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    help your charity or company to manage digital projects, bringing years of
    project management experience to bear
  </li>
  <li>
    create a clear plan for the projects we work on, but build in the need to
    adapt and be flexible
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Examples of our work</h3>
<p>
  James has been managing digital projects for more than twenty years. He has
  used traditional waterfall/Prince 2 approaches, but has a preference for
  contemporary agile approaches wherever possible.
