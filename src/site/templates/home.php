    We're careful to focus first on making things better for people

      – we don’t start with the technology, that comes later.</span>
  </p>
  <p>We:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      talk to the people who will feel the impact of a digital project right
      from the start to understand their needs before we starting making things
    </li>
    <li>
      make the simplest possible version of a digital thing and share it with
      people as early in the process as we can
    </li>
    <li>
      amend anything we make based on what people say about it or how we see
      them using it
    </li>
    <li>
      like to talk and share throughout a project, not just lock ourselves away
      and make things in isolation
    </li>
    <li>
      actively share knowledge and expertise - so once a project is finished,
      you have everything you need to work with the stuff we've helped you make
    </li>

    We carefully make digital things that are built to evolve and flourish – we don’t rush towards a

  </p>
  <p>We:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      design things to be as simple as they can be, but easy to expand and add
      to
    </li>
    <li>
      like to build things carefully by hand, so we know exactly how they work
    </li>
    <li>build testing into everything we do, right from the very start</li>
    <li>
      like to make small and regular changes to the things we make and see how
      they are received, rather than disappearing for months and coming up with
      a series of big, unexpected changes

    We're careful to think about the impact of our work on the wider environment
    and society
    <span> – we don’t make digital stuff in a vacuum</span>
  </p>
  <p>We:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>actively seek to do work that has a wider social benefit</li>
    <li>
      try to think about and understand the situations in which the things we
      make will be used
    </li>
    <li>

      try to ensure the lowest environmental footprint for our work, by:
      <ul>
        <li>
          designing the things we make, down to the level of individual web
          pages, to be as lightweight as possible, thereby reducing their energy
          use
        </li>
        <li>
          having the simplest possible kit we can, and using it for as long as
          we can
        </li>
        <li>using bike or train in preference to car wherever possible</li>
        <li>using video conferencing whenever it's appropriate</li>
      </ul>
