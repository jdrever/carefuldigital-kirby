<h2>Web Development</h2>
<p>
  James has been working on the web since 1997. Over that time, he has built up
  considerable technical expertise, but also an understanding of what works, and
  what is important. Recently, he has developed a series of sites
  using <a href="https://getkirby.com"></a>Kirby CMS and the <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a> static site generator but has a
  full understanding of all aspects of web development, and is happy to use
  whatever tools are appropriate to the job at hand.
</p>
<p>Our approach is as follow:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a preference to make things by hand</li>
  <li>keeping things as simple as we can</li>
  <li>
    thinking carefully about content and use of language as well as design and
    code
  </li>
  <li>
    focusing super-hard on performance - particularly in an environmental/energy/carbon context
  </li>
</ul>

    Careful Digital is a partner on this major EU-funded project. Natural Entrepreneurs is aimed at students across
    Europe, in the age range of 14 to 18 years.
    It is designed to introduce them to biomimicry – the identification of solutions found in nature and their
    application to human design.
    The project takes students through the biomimicry design process towards the development of sustainable design
    solutions, and actively encourages students to collaborate.
    One of the project outputs Careful Digital is responsible for is the Collaboration Platform; a website allowing
    students to work through the biomimicry design process in teams,
    accrue appreciation points, contribute to The Commons (a resource centre) and comment on other Teams’ ideas.

    <p>For this project, we needed to create and host a project website, a learning environnent and collaboration
      platform, all integrated into one seamless environment for our participants.
      We also needed the site needed to work in the five different languages of the participating countries.</p>

      user is of great importance to Careful Digital, and we like to ensure that our products are well tested before
      they are released. For educational projects, we work with schools and universities to build evidence of the User
      Experience and respond accordingly to make our products as appealing and efficient as possible.</p>

    Careful Digital is a partner on this major EU-funded project which brings
    together pupils in schools across Europe to create digital stories about
    climate change. One of the outputs of the project Careful Digital are
    responsible for is the development of a website to celebrate those stories.
    It allow visitors to search through and view the stories created, and
    hopefully be inspired to create their own stories.
  </p>
  <p>
    We worked with
    <a href="http://mynameismartin.com/about" target="_blank">Martin Wright</a>
    on the design of the site.

    </h4>
    <p>There was quite a complex technical challenge here, as the stories
      were made in a variety of digital formats, using
      different tools and technologies, and we needed to find a way to present those
      stories in as accessible way as possible. Plus the site needed to work in the five different languages of the
      participating countries.</p>

    <h5>TECHNICAL STUFF</h5>
    <p>
      The site was developed using
      the wonderful
      <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty static site generator</a>
      and we stored the stories in the equally wonderful
      <a href="https://sanity.io">Sanity CMS</a>
      , which allows complex content to
      be stored and searched easily. The separation of blisteringly fast static
      website and complex and sophisticated content management system will offer
      the best possible experience for editors and visitors to the site.
    </p>

  <p>We also created and hosted a Moodle learning environment for teachers for the schools involved in the trial.</p>

      component of the project.
      We've given technical advice on devices and software and planning advice on how to build the component into
      schemes of work.</p>

  <h5>Online Book about Moby Dick (2020)</h5>
  <p>
    In 2020 I moved many of my sites to the work as static sites on the
    Netlify platform, which provides exceptional levels of performance. I am writing an
    online book about Herman Melville's famous novel Moby Dick at
    <a href="https://moby.jamesdrever.co.uk">https://moby.jamesdrever.co.uk</a>.
    Part of this project is figuring out how best to create books online, and
    sharing that in an open source way so others can use the same techniques.

  </figure>
  <p class="technical">
    Technical: The challenge here is to allow the creation of content to be
    straightforward and separate as possible from the complexities of creating a
    coherent website design, so the "author" can just write, and the site will
    "magically" create it's own navigation. This site is also being developed
    using
    <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty static site generator</a> and being
    hosted by <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a>. The book is being
    written in Markdown, which allows non-tecnical users to create content which
    11ty then converts to a high-performance static website.
    I've made the code and content freely available on GitHub at
    <a href="https://github.com/jdrever/moby-dick-book"

  <h3>The Field Studies Council websites (2002-2017)</h3>
  <p>
    Between 2002 and 2017, I developed the main and various resources websites
    for the Field Studies Council. The main FSC website was large, including
    thousands of pages, and was updated by staff across the charity's 20
    locations. The site included bespoke ecommerce functionality allowing for
    the booking of courses and purchase of publications.
  </p>
  <p>
    There were many other sites I was involved in during this period. Amongst
    them were:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The Slapton Ley NNR website at
      <a href="https://slnnr.org.uk/">https://slnnr.org.uk/</a>

    <li>
      The Seashore website at

      <a href="https://www.lifeinfreshwater.org.uk/"
        >https://www.lifeinfreshwater.org.uk/</a
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      Eco Challenge, Eco Challenge Xtra, the Biodiversity Training Project,
      Invertebrate Challenge - all now sadly lost from the internet
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="technical">
    Technical: These websites were created using the Umbraco content management
    system, in which James was a
    <a href="/services/umbraco/">Certified Expert</a>. The bespoke ecommerce
    functionality on the main FSC site was developed in C# using MVC. The
    functionality was designed to be highly modular, using dependency injection.
    This allowed for unit testing of individual elements of the system, and for
    modules to be swapped in and out for testing and the outsourcing of work.

  <h5>The London Challenge New Views website (2006-7)</h5>
  <p>
    The London Challenge News View project allowed thousands of pupils at
    inner-city London schools to participate in residential experiences. I
    created the website for this project, which allowed schools to book with
    providers. The project ran across a number of major providers, including the
    Field Studies Council, PGL, YHA, who were able to make their residential
    experiences available to schools through the website. It was an amazing
    project to work on.

<h2>Reporting and Data work</h2>
<p>
  James has been working with reporting systems and data since his first
  commerical job in 1998. We have the following areas of expertise:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Data analysis and report creating (using SQL, or PowerBI)</li>
  <li>Data migration (using MySQL or SQL Server)</li>
  <li>Data quality work (using MySQL or SQL Server)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Examples of our work</h3>
<section class="case-study">
  <h5>The FSC data hub (2019-20)</h5>
  <p>
    We created a data hub, pulling both historical data from FSC's legacy system
    and from their new bookings management system, and set up a series of
    reports via PowerBI.
  </p>

  <p class="technical">
    Technical: This involved restructing data from a MySQL database and
    integrating the data into a SQL Server dataset.
