<h2>Web Development</h2>
<p>
  James has been working on the web since 1997. Over that time, he has built up
  considerable technical expertise, but also an understanding of what works, and
  what is important. He has developed a series of sites
  using the <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a> static site generator but has a
  full understanding of all aspects of web development, and is happy to use
  whatever tools are appropriate to the job at hand.
</p>
<p>Our approach is as follow:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a preference to make things by hand</li>
  <li>keeping things as simple as we can</li>
  <li>
    thinking carefully about content and use of language as well as design and
    code
  </li>
  <li>
    focusing super-hard on performance -

  <h5>Change the Story (2020)</h5>
  <p>
    Careful Digital is a partner on this major EU-funded project which brings
    together pupils in schools across Europe to create digital stories about
    climate change. One of the outputs of the project Careful Digital are
    responsible for is the development of a website to celebrate those stories.
    It will allow visitors to search through and view the stories created, and
    hopefully be inspired to create their own stories.

  <p class="technical">
    Technical: There is quite a complex technical challenge here, as the stories
    wil be in a variety of digital formats, with many of the stories using
    different tools and technologies, and we need to find a way to present those
    stories in as accessible way as possible. The site will be developed using
    the wonderful
    <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty static site generator</a> and we are
    looking at storing the stories in the equally wonderful
    <a href="https://sanity.io">Sanity CMS</a>, which allows complex content to
    be stored and searched easily. The separation of blisteringly fast static
    website and complex and sophisticated content management system will offer
    the best possible experience for editors and visitors to the site.

  <h5>Online Book about Moby Dick (2020)</h5>
  <p>
    I am in the progress of recreating and moving all my sites to a new
    platform (Netlifyhna), which provides exceptional levels of performance. I am writing an
    online book about Herman Melville's famous novel Moby Dick at
    <a href="https://moby.jamesdrever.co.uk">https://moby.jamesdrever.co.uk</a>.
    Part of this project is figuring out how best to create books online, and
    sharing that in an open source way so others can use the same techniques.

    <figcaption>The Moby Dick book cover image</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p class="technical">
    Technical: The challenge here is to allow the creation of content to be
    straightforward and separate as possible from the complexities of creating a
    coherent website design, so the "author" can just write, and the site will
    "magically" create it's own navigation. This site is also being developed
    using
    <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty static site generator</a> and being
    hosted by <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a>. The book is being
    written in Markdown, which allows non-tecnical users to create content which
    11ty then converts to a high-performance static website. The site gets the
    <a
      href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=moby.jamesdrever.co.uk"
      >highest possible rating from Google Page Speed</a
    >. I've made the code and content freely available on GitHub at
    <a href="https://github.com/jdrever/moby-dick-book"

  <h5>The Urban Science website (2019)</h5>
  <p>
    I created a website for the Urban Science EU project. The landing page for
    the project is at
    <a href="https://urbanscience.eu">https://urbanscience.eu</a> and the UK
    website is at
    <a href="https://urbanscience.eu/uk/">https://urbanscience.eu/uk/</a>. We
    did a lot of thinking about language and content for this website - how do
    we make the project relevant and exciting to it's main audience, teachers?

    system, in which James is a

  <h5>The Real World Learning Network website (2016-7)</h5>
  <p>
    This website supported the Real World Learning EU project. It is online at
    <a href="https://www.rwlnetwork.org/">https://www.rwlnetwork.org/</a>

  <p class="technical">
    Technical: The website were created using the Umbraco content management
    system, in which James was a
    Certified Expert. One of the exciting
    challenges was the RWL model
    <a href="https://www.rwlnetwork.org/rwl-model.aspx"
      >https://www.rwlnetwork.org/rwl-model.aspx</a
    >
    which features a hand design which brings the model to life. It was great
    fun working with Shrewsbury-based designer Martin Wright on this - Martin
    did a great job with the front-end design.

  <h5>The Field Studies Council websites (2002-2017)</h5>
  <p>
    Between 2002 and 2017, I developed the main and various resources websites
    for the Field Studies Council. The main FSC website was large, including
    thousands of pages, and was updated by staff across the charity's 20
    locations. The site included bespoke ecommerce functionality allowing for
    the booking of courses and purchase of publications.
  </p>
  <p>
    There were many other sites I was involved in during this period. Amongst
    them were:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The Slapton Ley NNR website at
      <a href="https://slnnr.org.uk/">https://slnnr.org.uk/</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      The Seashore website at
      <a href="https://www.theseashore.org.uk/"
        >https://www.theseashore.org.uk/</a
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      The Life in Freshwater website at
      <a href="https://www.lifeinfreshwater.org.uk/"
        >https://www.lifeinfreshwater.org.uk/</a
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      Eco Challenge, Eco Challenge Xtra, the Biodiversity Training Project,
      Invertebrate Challenge - all now sadly lost from the internet
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="technical">
    Technical: These websites were created using the Umbraco content management
    system, in which James is a
    <a href="/services/umbraco/">Certified Expert</a>. The bespoke ecommerce
    functionality on the main FSC site was developed in C# using MVC. The
    functionality was designed to be highly modular, using dependency injection.
    This allowed for unit testing of individual elements of the system, and for
    modules to be swapped in and out for testing and the outsourcing of work.

  <h5>The London Challenge New Views website (2006-7)</h5>
  <p>
    The London Challenge News View project allowed thousands of pupils at
    inner-city London schools to participate in residential experiences. I
    created the website for this project, which allowed schools to book with
    providers. The project ran across a number of major providers, including the
    Field Studies Council, PGL, YHA, who were able to make their residential
    experiences available to schools through the website. It was an amazing
    project to work on.

  <h5>The ANC website (1998-9)</h5>
  <p>
    This was my first commercial website - started in 1998. It was for the
    parcel company ANC, a truly dreadful first job (I could tell you some
    stories), but I learnt a lot. The website won an award, I later found out.

  </figure>
  <p class="technical">
    Technical: The site was made with Microsoft Active Server pages. I made the
    - then controversial - decision to use stylesheets. The site was built using
    frames but there was a non-frames version (I'd forgotten that - oh my lord.)

<h2>Reporting and Data work</h2>
<p>
  James has been working with reporting systems and data since his first
  commerical job in 1998. We have the following areas of expertise:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Data analysis and report creating (using SQL, or PowerBI)</li>
  <li>Data migration (using MySQL or SQL Server)</li>
  <li>Data quality work (using MySQL or SQL Server)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Examples of our work</h3>
<section class="case-study">
  <h5>The FSC data hub (2019-20)</h5>
  <p>
    We created a data hub, pulling both historical data from FSC's legacy system
    and from their new bookings management system, and set up a series of
    reports via PowerBI.
  </p>

  <p class="technical">
    Technical: This involved restructing data from a MySQL database and
    integrating the data into a SQL Server dataset.
