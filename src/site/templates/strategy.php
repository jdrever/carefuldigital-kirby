<h1>Strategy and Consultancy</h1>
<p>We can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    help your charity or company get a clear stategic plan for using digital
    technology that
    <ul>
      <li>ties in to your wider objectives</li>
      <li>involves the whole organisation</li>
      <li>
        balances the need for a clear long term plan with the recognition that
        in a rapidly changing world, any plan will need to adapt to that change
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    help to solve particular challenges, advising on where technology can help,
    and where you will need other solutions
  </li>

  <h5>The Bookings Review (Review phase)</h5>
  <p>
    This project for the Field Studies Council involved a holistic analysis of
    their bookings and administrative processes. A genuine digital
    transformation project, the review focused on:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>People</b>: rather than starting with technology or systems, we started
      by speaking to people, both customers and staff, to understand how the
      current processes and technology worked, what was working and what wasn't,
      and what was most important to the people directly involved in those
      processes.
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Processes</b>: we formally reviewed and documented processes, to be
      able to visualise and understand how those processes worked currently, and
      therefore how they could work better in the future
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Technology</b>: the final focus was on how to use technology to help
      make the improvements in People and Process.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    James led the development of FSC's IT/digital strategy to 2020. The strategy

    <li>Had conversations with other charities</li>
