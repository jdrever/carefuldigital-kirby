  Careful Digital are currently partners on two European Union Erasmus Plus funded environmental education projects:
  <a href="#natent">Natural Entrepreneurs</a>
  and
  <a href="#cts">Change the Story</a>
  .
  We are working with a major environmental education charity to develop their reporting infrastructure, helping a
  national health research charity with their organisation-wide digital transformation strategy, and have
  developed a website with the
  <a href="shropbot">Shropshire Botanical Society</a>
  to allow access to their biodiversity data.

  <h2>Nature Memory</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    We are starting to research and prototype a project called Nature Memory. Nature Memory will provide a way to build
    meaningful community links for schools, develop learning between the generations and make memories to share.

  <h2>Intentional Technology</h2>
  <p class="lead">
    Most of us now live in deep inter-dependence with digital technology. How do we develop an eco-system of digital
    helpers that works in relationship with our physical minds and bodies,
    and allow us to get things done while staying connected to the world around us? We are developing a course that
    guides individuals through these questions and helps find the best answers for them.</p>

    Careful Digital was delighted to deliver a website for the Shropshire Botanical Society to allow access to the
    Society's botanical records.

    <h4>TECHNICAL STUFF</h4>
    <p>Building on the excellent foundations the Society already had in place, we developed an PHP MVC web application

      queried the NBN's API.</p>

    Careful Digital is a partner on this major EU-funded project. Natural Entrepreneurs is aimed at students across
    Europe, in the age range of 14 to 18 years.
    It is designed to introduce them to biomimicry – the identification of solutions found in nature and their
    application to human design.
    The project takes students through the biomimicry design process towards the development of sustainable design
    solutions, and actively encourages students to collaborate.
    One of the project outputs Careful Digital is responsible for is the Collaboration Platform; a website allowing
    students to work through the biomimicry design process in teams,
    accrue appreciation points, contribute to The Commons (a resource centre) and comment on other Teams’ ideas.

    <p>For this project, we needed to create and host a project website, a learning environnent and collaboration
      platform, all integrated into one seamless environment for our participants.
      We also needed the site needed to work in the five different languages of the participating countries.</p>

    <h4>TECHNICAL STUFF</h4>
    <p>We built the website using WordPress, added the MemberPress plugin to provide the learning environment, and the
      Polygot plug to cater for the multi-lingual requirements.
      We then integrated in bespoke collaboration features that we developed in PHP.</p>

    <p>For this project, we have focused on the user's experience of the platform. Consistency and accessibility for the
      user is of great importance to Careful Digital, and we like to ensure that our products are well tested before
      they are released. For educational projects, we work with schools and universities to build evidence of the User
      Experience and respond accordingly to make our products as appealing and efficient as possible.</p>

    Careful Digital is a partner on this major EU-funded project which brings
    together pupils in schools across Europe to create digital stories about
    climate change. One of the outputs of the project Careful Digital are
    responsible for is the development of a website to celebrate those stories.
    It allow visitors to search through and view the stories created, and
    hopefully be inspired to create their own stories.

    We worked with
    <a href="http://mynameismartin.com/about" target="_blank">Martin Wright</a>
    on the design of the site.

    <p>There was quite a complex technical challenge here, as the stories
      were made in a variety of digital formats, using
      different tools and technologies, and we needed to find a way to present those
      stories in as accessible way as possible. Plus the site needed to work in the five different languages of the
      participating countries.</p>

    <h4>TECHNICAL STUFF</h4>
    <p>
      The site was developed using
      the wonderful
      <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty static site generator</a>
      and we stored the stories in the equally wonderful
      <a href="https://sanity.io">Sanity CMS</a>
      , which allows complex content to
      be stored and searched easily. The separation of blisteringly fast static
      website and complex and sophisticated content management system will offer
      the best possible experience for editors and visitors to the site.
    </p>

  <p>We also created and hosted a Moodle learning environment for teachers for the schools involved in the trial.</p>

    <p>Another element of our work on this project has been training teachers how to deliver the digital storymaking
      component of the project.
      We've given technical advice on devices and software and planning advice on how to build the component into
      schemes of work.</p>
