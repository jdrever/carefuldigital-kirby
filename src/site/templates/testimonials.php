  <p>We worked with Shropshire Botanical Society to provide online access to their botanical data.</p>
    <p><i>
        As a botanical society we have a responsibility to our members to try to make their data available to help
        conserve the plants in Shropshire. We had a small understanding of the work that was needed to create our online
        database but needed to be guided by a company we could trust to do the best job possible. Careful Digital were
        able to understand the scope and nature of the project and were sympathetic to our objectives. James took time
        to
        develop a relationship with staff at the National Biodiversity Network, who held our data within their own
        significantly larger database. He patiently developed an understanding of the API, spending some of his own time
        in order to better get to grips with a complex interface.
      </i></p>
    <p><i>The project was broken into several phases; enabling
        each to be delivered independently. This allowed a team within the botanical society to test, and provide
        feedback, before each phase went live. As each section was developed James worked diligently through any
        teething
        problems, responding promptly to feedback, correcting any problems quickly. Throughout the entire project
        Careful
        Digital were consistent in delivering everything that had been carefully designed. improving upon the design and
        functionality: on time and within budget. We are proud to be the only county in Britain to provide free online
        access to their botanical data.

        So when it then came to ensuring that the website would be hosted and maintained Careful Digital was the natural
        choice which has also proved to be another great decision as James hasn't taken his eye off the ball, responding
        quickly and taking time to understand problems, fixing them promptly and communicating effectively. </i>

    <i>I was part of a multi-disciplinary team managed by James, that worked on a charity-wide digital transformation
      project for FSC during 2018-2020. The Booking Admin Review project was aimed at improving the customer journey
      and increasing operational efficiency through the design and implementation of a fully integrated digital
      booking administration system.</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>James’s approach of working with People, Processes and Technology (in that order) meant that the project had a
      solid foundation of user engagement and collaboration right from the outset, which contributed significantly to
      its success.</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>James’ clear sighted vision, patience and creativity was invaluable in positively navigating the varied and
      complex needs of the project stakeholders. He is adept at handling detail while maintaining a holistic and
      strategic overview of the project. His leadership and coaching, being mindful of the various implications and
      dependencies of any change, resulted in a team that created better solutions at the outset as well as ongoing
      dialogue for continuous improvement in the future. </i>

  <p>
    <i>As well as his technical capability, it is James’s ability to connect and communicate with the users of
      technology that is so inspiring and valuable.</i>

    Steve Tilling was Director of Communications at the Field Studies Council
    when I joined the charity. We worked together for a number of years on a
    number of projects, including London Challenge New Views, for which I
    produced a website that managed the booking process for children from London
    schools getting a residential experience through a variety of providers.

    <i>
      I’ve worked with James for over 15 years on many initiatives including
      some high-profile and large-scale national IT projects. Throughout that
      time I have been hugely impressed with his imagination, creativity and
      management skills. James is always a beacon of calm and dependability and
      somehow manages to create a sensible and workable solution, even when
      those of us around him have struggled to see any light going forward.</i>

    I worked with Richard Dawson, then Global Projects Manager at Field Studies
    Council, on a series of global environmental education projects.

    <i>
      James and I have worked together on several projects to develop an online
      presence. Initially this came from James helping to rescue projects that
      had gone awry; his clear thinking and precision has been much appreciated
      in seeing through the haze of unclear information and mis-directed ideas.
      This has led to working with James to develop websites from scratch. A
      recent example is the Real World Learning Network website. James provided
      clarity in formulating the purpose and possibility of the website,
      ensuring it ‘does what it says on the tin.’ He managed the technical side
      of development and established a clear Umbraco multi-language web editing
      platform which gave both flexibility and security. He has always responded
      positively to the need for change as projects develop and websites needs
      change. Finally, James has a finely honed quality in seeing what the
      client needs to communicate, rather than focusing on the latest technical
      wizardry.</i>

    I worked with Steve from Ironworks to get his website working effectively
    for his business.

    <i>
      James has been an invaluable part of my business and I can’t recommend
      his services enough. He is very approachable and brought a wealth of
      knowledge to the implementation of my website. I basically had a site that
      wasn’t working and didn’t generate any business. However James transformed
      this and very quickly created a working bespoke website that has
      successfully underpinned my business for the last six years. I can’t thank
      him enough for the input he’s had.</i>
