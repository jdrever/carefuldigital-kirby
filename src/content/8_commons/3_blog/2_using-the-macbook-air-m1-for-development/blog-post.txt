Maincontent: [{"content":{"text":"<p>About eighteen months ago I was really struggling with using my ageing Dell XPS laptop for software development.<\/p><p>It was just about ok for working on simple Visual Studio .NET application projects, but as Careful Digital began to take on more projects, I was needing to work with a variety of different technology stacks: Windows and Linux, .NET and PHP, SQL Server and mySQL. I tried to use Docker to create Linux environments using Windows on the XPS, but they were unusably slow. And the fan was making an increasingly wretched noise on an almost continious basis (pretty much whenever OneDrive tried to do a sync, which never seemed to cease).<\/p><p>I'd heard various reports that the new M1 chips used in the then fairly recent Macbook Air and Pro were an amazing step forward in terms of laptop performance and I eventually decided to investigate.<\/p><p><strong>The short version of this post is that the M1 Macbook Air is a fantastic laptop for development purposes.<\/strong><\/p><p>More to come shortly!<\/p>"},"id":"e06ce437-734d-4b84-a976-60dcdfb77c96","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
